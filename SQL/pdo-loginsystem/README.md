# PDO-loginsystem

Simple loginsystem where a user can register with a username and email. Database checks if username already exists, also checks if both password inputfields are equal and then hashes it into the database. A php session will check if the there is a login session, if there is the user will not see the registration form and different interfaces or pages can be shown.
